# Docker Ofelia acme.sh

#### This is a simple daemon container that leverages ofelia cron scheduling to renew ssl certificates generated by https://acme.sh

## Setup

1) Edit the [config.ini](config.ini)
	1) Update the absolute volume paths
	1) Set the schedule based on the GO implementation of cron ([link](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format)) which is not the common standard
1) If you already have existing acme.<span>sh certs, place the files in the following file structure
```
./acme.sh
	./certs
		./example.com
		./mysite.com
	./configs
		./ca
			./...
			./...
		./account.conf
		./http.header
```
