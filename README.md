# Docker Ofelia acme.sh

#### This is a simple daemon container that leverages ofelia cron scheduling to renew ssl certificates generated by https://acme.sh

## Setup

1) Edit the [config.ini](config.ini)
	1) Update the absolute volume paths
	1) Set the schedule based on the GO implementation of cron ([link](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format)) which is not the common standard
1) If you already have existing acme.<span>sh certs, place the files in the following file structure
```
acme.sh
|
|__ certs
|	|
|	|__ example.com (dir)
|	|
|	|__ mysite.com (dir)
|
|__ configs
	|
	|__ ca (dir)
	|
	|__ account.conf (file)
